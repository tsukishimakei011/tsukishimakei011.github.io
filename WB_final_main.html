            <p class="meta">In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. In colloquial use, a metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.</p>

                <p>The term "metaverse" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe". Metaverse development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology due to increasing demands for immersion. Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3, a concept for a decentralized iteration of the internet. Web3 and the Metaverse have been used as buzzwords to exaggerate development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes. Information privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.</p>

            <p>Access points for the metaverse includes general-purpose computers and smartphones, augmented, reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality. Current hardware development is focused on overcoming limitations of VR headsets, sensors, and increasing immersion with haptic technology</p>

        <div class="tab-contents " id="software">
            <p>There has been no wide-scale adoption of a standardized technical specification for metaverse implementations, and existing implementations rely primarily on proprietary technology. Interoperability is a major concern in metaverse development, stemming from concerns about transparency and privacy. There have been several virtual environment standardization projects</p>

               <h1 class="sub-title">NFT</h1>
            <p class="meta1">A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, that is recorded in a blockchain, and that is used to, certify authenticity and ownership. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. NFTs can be created by anybody, and require few or no coding skills to create. NFTs typically contain references to digital files such as photos, videos, and audio. Because NFTs are uniquely identifiable assets, they differ from cryptocurrencies, which are fungible.

                Proponents of NFTs claim that NFTs provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership, but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain. </p>

       <p class="why1">The metaverse could fundamentally change not only how humans interact with technology but also how they interact with each other and the world around them. Experts predicted that the market for 3D metaverse technology for entertainment, media, art, fashion and retail will reach $426.9 billion by 2027, while Gartner placed the enterprise digital twins marketplace at $183 billion by 2031. Thus, from here, we are able to understand that The Metaverses will become our next future as it provided many benefits in every aspects such as:</p>
